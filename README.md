# treasure-map-mvp

**How the game works...**

- Go to these places of interest on the map
- Collect NFTs / tokens by following these instructions... -> [yet to exist]
- Go to the announced meeting point to redeem tokens for swag (end of DEVCON)

**Current places of interest:** (add more here and on the map as well...)

- Status hackathon
- Ethereum Magicians Council of Prague
- Devcon IV
- + other events as they come

You get 1 token as you go to each event. (needs to be sybil resistant some how)

**Rewards Chart / Game economics**

// I literally don't know what I am doing here, I just conjured up a random basic game, numbers are just rough ratios not exact numbers and I don't even know if the economics of the games work

3000 people attending devcon. lets say at somehow only each person can collect 5 max tokens by themselves. (we also need potential posters or info at the events to tell people about the existance of the treasure map thing)

20 tokens = rare t-shirt (only 20~ existing)
10 tokens = rare hat (30~ existing)
9 tokens = common t-shirt (60~ t-shirts)
6 tokens = sticker pack

**Swag list**
- T-shirt rare
- T-shirt common
- Different sticker designs
