// anyone can pr to this without a review, be sensible

**How the game works...**

- Go to these places of interest on the map
- Collect NFTs / tokens by following these instructions... -> [yet to exist]
- Go to the announced meeting point to redeem tokens for swag (end of DEVCON)

**Token game**

events 

- Status hackathon
- Ethereum Magicians Council of Prague
- Devcon IV
- + other events as they come

Lets assume there will be 12 events across the week in total and you can only redeem 1 token at each event. (sybil resistance)

There are limited amount of tokens available at each event but more than enough for everyone to claim.

18 tokens = rare t shirt
12 tokens = common t shirt
6 = some stickers
